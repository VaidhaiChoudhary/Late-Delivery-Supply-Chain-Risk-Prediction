# Late-Delivery-Supply-Chain-Risk-Prediction
To compare ML algorithms to identify delayed deliveries using two different datasets: Supply Chain Shipment Pricing Dataset by USAID (United States Agency for International Development) and DataCo Global Supply Chain Dataset. 
This assesses how well several ML algorithms, which include 7 classifiers and 6 regressors, forecast delays and identify the variables that contribute to late delivery.

Here is the flow of this project:
